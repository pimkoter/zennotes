Raycast uses it for search, then uses `zennotes://open` and `zennotes://open-window` links to bring the selected note back into ZenNotes.

Beyond math, four fenced block languages turn into live diagrams in preview and split mode: `mermaid` for flow, sequence, state, gantt, and graph diagrams; `tikz` for LaTeX-native coordinate systems, commutative diagrams, and figure-quality plots (the TeX engine runs on-device so no network is required); `jsxgraph` for interactive geometry and function plots driven by a small JSON config; and `function-plot` for compact Cartesian function plotting. Each block is ordinary markdown on disk, so the source remains portable and diffable.'
